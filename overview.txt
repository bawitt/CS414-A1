This project provides the functionality to create companies, workers, projects and qualifications,
which are used in conjunction to manage projects at a company.  Workers are created and hired, then
added to projects for which they may assist in meeting the qualifications for completion.  These 
workers can also be fired and their qualification efforts will be removed from projects which will 
subsequently be reevaluated for requisite included qualifications. Company, worker, project and 
qualifications will be managed within the application and added/removed as needed (based on spec).

The major factor in my early struggles on this project was getting used to more advanced java (and eclipse) 
sinceI am by no means an expert on this language.  After doing some research and working out some of the 
kinks, I was able to get an idea for my basic structure and how to go about it.  After this, everything
seemed to fall into place since this the concepts involved with this program flow well and are very
logical.  I felt slightly overwhelmed at first but, by taking a step back then thinking about the 
program in smaller pieces, I was able to focus better and now definitely feel more confident going into 
the next set of assignments.
